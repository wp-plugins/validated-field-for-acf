The Validated Field add-on for Advanced Custom Fields provides input masking and validation of other field types.

== Description ==
= Validated Field Add-On =
The **Validated Field** add-on for [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/)
provides a wrapper for other input types which allows you to provide client side input masking using the jQuery 
[Masked Input Plugin](http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/), server side validation using either PHP regular expressions 
or PHP code, the option of ensuring a field's uniqueness by `post_type` and `meta_key`, `post_type`, or site wide, as well as marking a field as read-only.

= Features =
1. **Input Masking** - easily set masks on text inputs to ensure data is properly formatted.
2. **Server Side Validation** - validate the inputs using server side PHP code or regular expressions.
3. **Uniqueness** - ensure that the value being updated is not already in use.
4. **Repeater Fields** - validated fields within a [Repeater Field](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/add-ons/repeater-field/).
5. **Read Only** - specify a field a read-only allowing it to be displayed but not updated. *BETA*

= Compatibility =
Requires [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) version 4.0 or greater.

== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin and extract to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure validated fields within the Advanced Custom Fields menus

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I've activated the Validated Field plugin, but nothing happens =
Ensure that you have [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) installed, and that it is activated. 
Validated Field will appear as a new input type in the field group editor.

= Configuration Options =
Global configurations for the Validated Field plugin can be found in the WordPress Admin under `Custom Fields > Validated Field Settings`.

== Screenshots ==
1. Example configuration to validate a telephone number field.
2. Example of a conflict - the same telephone number already exists, with a link to the existing record.
3. Example of PHP validation - checking the length of a fieldâ€™s value.
4. Example of PHP validation failure with the error message raised to the UI.
